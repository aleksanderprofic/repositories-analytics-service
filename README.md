# Repositories Analytics Service

Backend module for the Repositories Analytics System. 

## Endpoints

### Repository information

Service sends requests directly to the provider's API (currently only GitHub, 
but in the future also from Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.) and extracts/modifies the data 
it returns. Then, returns the repository information as a JSON in the following format:
```
{
    "languages": {
        "<language_name>": <percentage_value>
    }, 
    "repositoryStatistics": {
        "<statistic>": <value>
    },
    "branches": [
        {
            "name": "<name>",
            "commits": [<commits>]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Files metrics

Metrics format returned by the endpoint:
```
{
    "<commit_hash>": {
        "<language_name>": {
            "<file_path>": {
                "<metric_name>": <value>
            }
        }
    }
}
```
By default, service gets currently available metrics from the database and returns 
them to the user in the above format. In case the `get_currently_available` 
parameter is set to `false`, service first checks if ALL metrics are available 
for specified commits and repository. Then:
- If yes, it returns the metrics for all files within specified commits and repository 
as a JSON in the above format.
- If no, it sends the message to the `downloader` queue in the following format:
```
{
    "repo_id": string,
    "git_url": string,
    "languages": [int],
    "commits": [string]
}
```
that starts the chain of downloading, extracting and analyzing the files in 
the specified commits and repository.
